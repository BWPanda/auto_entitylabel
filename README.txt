Automatic Nodetitle Module
------------------------
by Wolfgang Ziegler, nuppla@zites.net


Description
-----------
This is a small and efficent module that allows hiding of the node title field. To prevent
empty node title fields it sets the title to the content type name.

Advanced users can also provide some PHP code, that is used for automatically generating an
appropriate title.


Installation 
------------
 * Copy the module to your modules directory and activate it.
 * Activate it for some content-types at 'admin/settings/content-types'.
